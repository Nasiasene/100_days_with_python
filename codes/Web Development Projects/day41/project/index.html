        <h3>Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
        <p>I love this movie for lots of reasons, but in specific, its fast and frantic direction plus Leonardo di Caprio's brilliant performance.</p>
        <h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
        <p>This was the first film i watched directed by Tarantino and it was an totally unique experience, the humor and the relaxed way in which the film is told are things i really like.</p>
        <h3>***** ****</h3>
