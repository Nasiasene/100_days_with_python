Selenium is used with a similar purpose to Bs, however, with selenium, it is also possible to interact with webpages like doing clicks etc.


to use selenium you need to select a specific browser, be it chrome, safari, firefox etc.

after downloading a specific driver for the browser, you will be able to use selenium, just specify the web page you want to access and that's it.

ex:
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service

service = Service("C:\Developer\chromedriver.exe")
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service)
 
driver.get("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page")
// In this way it imports and opens a site with selenium.


selenium tabem can be used for webscrapping/selecting elements.
ex:
driver.get("https://www.amazon.com.br")

name = driver.find_element(By.ID, "productTitle")

price = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "a-price-whole")

link = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "#centerCol a")

res = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="productOverview_feature_div"]/div/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[2]/span')


print(name.text)
print(price.text)
print(link.text)
print(res.text)
//to go after a specific element you must use the fin_... command and use the By parameter
//By.CSS_SELECTOR: this way you search for an element through its element in css.
//By.CLASS_NAME: searches for an element through its class.
//By.ID: Search by the id of an element.
//By.XPATH: search for XPATH, it is possible to obtain it by inspecting an element and pasting it.
//.text: with the element already collected, this command serves to show the text present in it

//driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, "...")
//driver.find_element(By.NAME, "...")



Now here some interection actions that can be make with selenium:

+element.click()
+element.send_keys("...")
+element.send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
//ENTER, TAB, SHIFT...
