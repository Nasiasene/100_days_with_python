+ Beautiful Soup/Web Scrapping

Beautiful Soup library serves to extract data from html files


ex:
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

file = open(r"C:\Users\davit\Documents\100days_python.py\100_days_with_python\codes\Days 32-57 (Intermediate+)\day45\website.html", encoding="utf-8")
content = file.read()
file.close()

soup = BeautifulSoup(content, 'html.parser')
print(soup.title.string, "\n\nPARAGRAPHS:")

paragraphs = soup.find_all(name="p")
for i in paragraphs:
    print(i.getText())

print("\n\nLinks:")
anchor_tags = soup.find_all("a")
for i in anchor_tags:
    print(f"Str: {i.getText()} // Link: {i.get('href')}")

heading = soup.find(name="h1", id="name")


url = soup.select_one(selector="p a")
all_url = soup.select(selector="a")


//find = find the first element with this tag, id or class.
//find_all = find all elements. name="tag". Returns a "list" of elements.
//apply the "." it only works if the element being selected is just an element in html.
//the selector looks for the element in the same way as the css.



to load a web page it is necessary to use requests and transform it into a text.

ex:
import requests as r

response = r.get("https://news.ycombinator.com/news")
html = response.text
