* Local Scope:
When i creat a thing (variable, or a new function for exemple) inside a function, this thing can only be acessed inside it.

 + ex:
def hello():
    hi = 0
    print(hi)  \\  This will be printed.

print(hi)  \\  This will not be printed.

* Global Scope:
When you define a variable, for exemple, in the code (outside a function), you can use this variable for wathever you want.

 + ex:
 hi = 0
 def hello():  
    print(hi)  \\  This will be printed.

print(hi)  \\  This will be printed.


++obs1:  if you create a variable inside of an if-else or while/for loop, this variable has an Global Scope.

++ obs2: to change a global scope inside a function you can:
1.
hello = 0   
def hi():
    global hello 
    '''here i say that if i put an 'hello' variable inide this function he will be refers at the global vvariable with the same name'''

    hello = 1

hi()
print(hello)  \\  return 1

2.
hello = 0
def hi():
        return hello + 1

print(hi())


* CONSTANT:
To define a constant you need to define as a normal variable but in upper case.

ex:
PI = 3.1415
URL = 'https://www.google.com'
