+ Class Inheritance
when I want to create a class that has attributes similar to another already created

to do this, just create a class using another class as a parameter:


class Fish(Animal):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()  #it is not obligatory to put it, only if I am going to use something inside a function, for example.

to call a super class function, just:

class Fish(Animal):
    ...

    def teste(self):  
        super().function() #this way i utilize a super class function.



+ Slicing:
We get a range of objects from a list through its index.

ex:
test = [2, 5, 6, 8]
test[1:3]  //  [5, 6] #dont take the last index.

test = [2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 20]
test[::-1]  //  [20, 9, 8, 7, 5, 2]  #read the list backwards.
