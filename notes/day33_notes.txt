*it is worth remembering that whenever we open a web page we make a request to enter it before entering.


+ Requests: to be able to work with API in python, you will need the requests library, in which you can manipulate data from the api.

ex:
import requests as r

response = r.get(url)

get : we asked for data and received it.
post: we send date.
put : updates the data.
delete : delete data.
